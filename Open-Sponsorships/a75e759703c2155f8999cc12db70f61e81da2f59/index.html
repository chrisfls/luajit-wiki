<p>This is a list of ports, features and other work items that are planned
for LuaJIT and are still in need of a sponsor.</p>

<p>If you want to see any of these features in a future version of LuaJIT
and are interested in sponsoring them, please read:
<a href="http://luajit.org/sponsors.html" rel="nofollow">http://luajit.org/sponsors.html</a> -- Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>Note: The main LuaJIT author (Mike Pall) is working on unrelated
projects and cannot accept new sponsorships at this time. But other
community members may be open to sponsorship offers -- please ask on the
LuaJIT mailing list for any takers.</strong></p>

<p>Please note that some of the items in this list are dependent on others,
which would have to be implemented first.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="ports-to-more-cpu-architectures" href="#ports-to-more-cpu-architectures"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>Ports to More CPU Architectures</h2>

<p>LuaJIT 2.0 has already been ported to the major CPU architectures and
some of their variants. It currently supports x86, x64, ARM (ARM 32 bit
instruction set only), PPC (PPC32 only), PPC/e500 (no JIT) and MIPS
(FPU required).</p>

<p>The following ports are missing and would be a) feasible and b)
interesting to have:</p>

<h3><a class="anchor" id="ports-to-more-cpu-architectures_arm-thumb2-port" href="#ports-to-more-cpu-architectures_arm-thumb2-port"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>ARM Thumb2 Port</h3>

<p>The current ARM port of LuaJIT only supports the 32 bit ARM instruction
set. The interpreter core is written with the 32 bit ARM instruction set
in mind and the JIT backend can only emit 32 bit ARM machine code.</p>

<p>Some newer ARM devices, such as the Cortex-M family are popular in
low-power and embedded environments, but only support the (16 bit)
Thumb2 instruction set.</p>

<h3><a class="anchor" id="ports-to-more-cpu-architectures_mips-soft-float-and-dual-number-port" href="#ports-to-more-cpu-architectures_mips-soft-float-and-dual-number-port"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>MIPS Soft-Float and Dual-Number Port</h3>

<p>Many embedded devices use MIPS CPUs without a hardware FPU. A soft-float
and dual-number port would allow them to use LuaJIT, e.g. for routers
running OpenWRT.</p>

<h3><a class="anchor" id="ports-to-more-cpu-architectures_sh4-port" href="#ports-to-more-cpu-architectures_sh4-port"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>SH4 Port</h3>

<p>The SH4 CPU family is popular in embedded applications and a port of
LuaJIT would be welcome by the embedded developer community.</p>

<h3><a class="anchor" id="ports-to-more-cpu-architectures_other-ports" href="#ports-to-more-cpu-architectures_other-ports"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>Other Ports</h3>

<p>There are a couple more CPU architectures or architectural variants left
that are not yet supported by LuaJIT. Whether a port makes sense or not,
depends on several factors:</p>

<ol>
<li>The CPU/ABI must have a memory model that's compatible with LuaJIT.</li>
<li>The architecture must have a reasonable market share.</li>
<li>The architecture is not dying anytime soon.</li>
</ol>

<p>The last item is a bit subjective, of course. :-)</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="new-garbage-collector-for-luajit-3-0" href="#new-garbage-collector-for-luajit-3-0"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>New Garbage Collector for LuaJIT 3.0</h2>

<p>The garbage collector used by LuaJIT 2.x is essentially the same as the
Lua 5.1 GC. The current garbage collector is relatively slow compared to
implementations for other language runtimes. It's not competitive with
top-of-the-line GCs, especially for large workloads.</p>

<p>The main feature planned for LuaJIT 3.0 is a complete redesign of the
garbage collector from scratch: the <a class="internal present" href="/luajit-wiki/New-Garbage-Collector" rel="nofollow">new garbage collector</a> will be an
arena-based, quad-color incremental, generational, non-copying,
high-speed, cache-optimized garbage collector.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="metatable-__index-specialization" href="#metatable-__index-specialization"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>Metatable/__index Specialization</h2>

<p>Accesses to metatables and <code>__index</code> tables with constant keys are
already specialized by the JIT compiler to use optimized hash lookups
(<code>HREFK</code>). This is based on the assumption that individual objects don't
change their metatable (once assigned) and that neither the metatable
nor the <code>__index</code> table are modified. This turns out to be true in
practice, but those assumptions still need to be checked at runtime,
which can become costly for OO-heavy programming.</p>

<p>Further specialization can be obtained by strictly relying on these
assumptions and omitting the related checks in the generated code. In
case any of the assumptions are broken (e.g. a metatable is written to),
the previously generated code must be invalidated or flushed.</p>

<p>Different mechanisms for detecting broken assumptions and for
invalidating the generated code should be evaluated.</p>

<p>This optimization works at the lowest implementation level for
metatables in the VM. It should equally benefit any code that uses
metatables, not just the typical frameworks that implement a class-based
system on top of it.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="value-range-propagation-vrp" href="#value-range-propagation-vrp"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>Value-Range Propagation (VRP)</h2>

<p>Value-range propagation is an optimization for the JIT compiler: by
propagating the possible ranges for a value, subsequent code may be
optimized or conditionals may be eliminated. Constant propagation
(already implemented) can be seen as a special case of this
optimization.</p>

<p>E.g. if a number is known to be in the range <code>0 &lt;= x &lt; 256</code> (say it
originates from <code>string.byte</code>), then a later mask operation <code>bit.band(x,
255)</code> is redundant. Similarly, a subsequent test for <code>x &lt; 0</code> can be
eliminated.</p>

<p>Note that even though few programmers would explicitly write such a
series of operations, this can easily happen after inlining of functions
combined with constant propagation.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="hyperblock-scheduling" href="#hyperblock-scheduling"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>Hyperblock Scheduling</h2>

<p>Producing good code for unbiased branches is a key problem for trace
compilers. This is the main cause for "trace explosion" and bad
performance with certain types of branchy code.</p>

<p>Hyperblock scheduling promises to solve this nicely at the price of a
major redesign of the compiler: selected traces are woven together to a
single hyper-trace. This would also pave the way for emitting predicated
instructions, which benefits some CPUs (e.g. ARM) and is a prerequisite
for efficient vectorization.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="ffi-c-pre-processor" href="#ffi-c-pre-processor"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>FFI C Pre-Processor</h2>

<p>The integrated C parser of the FFI library currently doesn't support
<code>#define</code> or other C pre-processor features. To support the full range
of C semantics, an integrated C pre-processor is needed.</p>

<p>This would provide a nice solution to the C re-declaration problem for
FFI modules, too.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="user-definable-intrinsics-for-the-ffi" href="#user-definable-intrinsics-for-the-ffi"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>User-Definable Intrinsics for the FFI</h2>

<p>This is a low-level equivalent to GCC inline assembler: given a C
function declaration and a machine code template, an intrinsic function
(builtin) can be constructed and later called. This allows generating
and executing arbitrary instructions supported by the target CPU. The
JIT compiler inlines the intrinsic into the generated machine code for
maximum performance.</p>

<p>Developers usually shouldn't need to write machine code templates
themselves. Common libraries of intrinsics for different purposes should
be provided or contributed by experts.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="vector-simd-data-type-support-for-the-ffi" href="#vector-simd-data-type-support-for-the-ffi"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>Vector/SIMD Data Type Support for the FFI</h2>

<p>Currently, vector data types may be defined with the FFI, but you really
can't do much with them. The goal of this project is to add full support
for vector data types to the JIT compiler and the CPU-specific backends
(if the target CPU has a vector extension).</p>

<p>A new <code>"ffi.vec"</code> module declares standard vector types and attaches the
machine-specific SIMD intrinsics as (meta)methods.</p>

<p>Prerequisites for this project are allocation sinking, user-definable
intrinsics and the new garbage collector.</p>
